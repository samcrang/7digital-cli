7digital CLI
============

A command-line tool for interacting with the 7digital API.

Installation
------------

You'll need to set the `SEVENDIGITAL_CONSUMER_KEY` and `SEVENDIGITAL_CONSUMER_SECRET` environment variables to whatever they should be.

Usage
-----

Until I get round to bundling this up as a gem you can do something along the lines of the following:

```
$ SEVENDIGITAL_CONSUMER_KEY='YOUR_KEY_HERE' SEVENDIGITAL_CONSUMER_SECRET='YOUR_SECRET_HERE' bin/7d sign clip 1234
```
